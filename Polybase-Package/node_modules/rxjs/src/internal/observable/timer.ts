/**
 * Creates an Observable that starts emitting after an `dueTime` and
 * emits ever increasing numbers after each `period` of time thereafter.
 *
 * <span class="informal">Its like {@link index/interval}, but you can specify when
 * should the emissions start.</span>
 *
 * ![](timer.png)
 *
 * `timer` returns an Observable that emits an infinite sequence of ascending
 * integers, with a constant interval of time, `period` of your choosing
 * between those emissions. The first emission happens after the specified
 * `dueTime`. The initial delay may be a `Date`. By default, this
 * operator uses the {@link asyncScheduler} {@link SchedulerLike} to provide a notion of time, but you
 * may pass any {@link SchedulerLike} to it. If `period` is not specified, the output
 * Observable emits only one value, `0`. Otherwise, it emits an infinite
 * sequence.
 *
 * ## Examples
 * ### Emits ascending numbers, one every second (1000ms), starting after 3 seconds
 * ```ts
 * import { timer } from 'rxjs';
 *
 * const numbers = timer(3000, 1000);
 * numbers.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
 * ```
 *
 * ### Emits one number after five seconds
 * ```ts
 * import { timer } from 'rxjs';
 *
 * const numbers = timer(5000);
 * numbers.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
 * ```
 * @see {@link index/interval}
 * @see {@link delay}
 *
 * @param {number|Date} [dueTime] The initial delay time specified as a Date object or as an integer denoting
 * milliseconds to wait before emitting the first value of 0`.
 * @param {number|SchedulerLike} [periodOrScheduler] The period of time between emissions of the
 * subsequent numbers.
 * @param {SchedulerLike} [scheduler=async] The {@link SchedulerLike} to use for scheduling
 * the emission of values, and providing a notion of "time".
 * @return {Observable} An Observable that emits a `0` after the
 * `dueTime` and ever increasing numbers after each `period` of time
 * thereafter.
 * @static true
 * @name timer
 * @owner Observable

/**
 * Creates an observable that will wait for a specified time period, or exact date, before
 * emitting the number 0.
 *
 * <span class="informal">Used to emit a notification after a delay.</span>
 *
 * This observable is useful for creating delays in code, or racing against other values
 * for ad-hoc timeouts.
 *
 * The `delay` is specified by default in milliseconds, however providing a custom scheduler could
 * create a different behavior.
 *
 * ## Examples
 *
 * Wait 3 seconds and start another observable
 *
 * You might want to use `timer` to delay subscription to an
 * observable by a set amount of time. Here we use a timer with
 * {@link concatMapTo} or {@link concatMap} in order to wait
 * a few seconds and start a subscription to a source.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { of, timer, concatMap } from 'rxjs';
 *
 * // This could be any observable
 * const source = of(1, 2, 3);
 *
 * timer(3000)
 *   .pipe(concatMap(() => source))
 *   .subscribe(console.log);
 * ```
 *
 * Take all values until the start of the next minute
 *
 * Using a `Date` as the trigger for the first emission, you can
 * do things like wait until midnight to fire an event, or in this case,
 * wait until a new minute starts (chosen so the example wouldn't take
 * too long to run) in order to stop watching a stream. Leveraging
 * {@link takeUntil}.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { interval, takeUntil, timer } from 'rxjs';
 *
 * // Build a Date object that marks the
 * // next minute.
 * const currentDate = new Date();
 * const startOfNextMinute = new Date(
 *   currentDate.getFullYear(),
 *   currentDate.getMonth(),
 *   currentDate.getDate(),
 *   currentDate.getHours(),
 *   currentDate.getMinutes() + 1
 * );
 *
 * // This could be any observable stream
 * const source = interval(1000);
 *
 * const result = source.pipe(
 *   takeUntil(timer(startOfNextMinute))
 * );
 *
 * result.subscribe(console.log);
 * ```
 *
 * ### Known Limitations
 *
 * - The {@link asyncScheduler} uses `setTimeout` which has limitations for how far in the future it can be scheduled.
 *
 * - If a `scheduler` is provided that returns a timestamp other than an epoch from `now()`, and
 * a `Date` object is passed to the `dueTime` argument, the calculation for when the first emission
 * should occur will be incorrect. In this case, it would be best to do your own calculations
 * ahead of time, and pass a `number` in as the `dueTime`.
 *
 * @param due If a `number`, the amount of time in milliseconds to wait before emitting.
 * If a `Date`, the exact time at which to emit.
 * @param scheduler The scheduler to use to schedule the delay. Defaults to {@link asyncScheduler}.

/**
 * Creates an observable that starts an interval after a specified delay, emitting incrementing numbers -- starting at `0` --
 * on each interval after words.
 *
 * The `delay` and `intervalDuration` are specified by default in milliseconds, however providing a custom scheduler could
 * create a different behavior.
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * ### Start an interval that starts right away
 *
 * Since {@link interval} waits for the passed delay before starting,
 * sometimes that's not ideal. You may want to start an interval immediately.
 * `timer` works well for this. Here we have both side-by-side so you can
 * see them in comparison.
 *
 * Note that this observable will never complete.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { timer, interval } from 'rxjs';
 *
 * timer(0, 1000).subscribe(n => console.log('timer', n));
 * interval(1000).subscribe(n => console.log('interval', n));
 * ```
 *
 * ### Known Limitations
 *
 * - The {@link asyncScheduler} uses `setTimeout` which has limitations for how far in the future it can be scheduled.
 *
 * - If a `scheduler` is provided that returns a timestamp other than an epoch from `now()`, and
 * a `Date` object is passed to the `dueTime` argument, the calculation for when the first emission
 * should occur will be incorrect. In this case, it would be best to do your own calculations
 * ahead of time, and pass a `number` in as the `startDue`.
 * @param startDue If a `number`, is the time to wait before starting the interval.
 * If a `Date`, is the exact time at which to start the interval.
 * @param intervalDuration The delay between each value emitted in the interval. Passing a
 * negative number here will result in immediate completion after the first value is emitted, as though
 * no `intervalDuration` was passed at all.
 * @param scheduler The scheduler to use to schedule the delay. Defaults to {@link asyncScheduler}.
