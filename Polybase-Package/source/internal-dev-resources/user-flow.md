### **1. User Input via CLI (source/presentation)**

- **`cli-interface.js`**:
  - user inputs a command into the CLI.
  - captures & command and parses it into some standarized/structured request object containing all of the required information, e.g. database type, operation, other relevant parameters (?).
  - parsed req object is then passed to the `db-interface.js` module

### **2. Handling the Request (source/presentation)**

- **`db-interface.js`**:
  - receives the structured request object from `cli-interface.js`
  - mediates btwn presentation and core layers.
  - parses reques object and passes to the `query-processor.js` in the core layer

### **3. Processing the Query (source/core)**

- **`query-processor.js`**:
  - receivs request obj from the `db-interface.js`.
  - further parses query -validating actual components and setting up the execution plan for this flow .
  - xecution plan passed to the respective adapter in the `transformation` layer (e.g `sql-adapter.js`, `nosql-adapter.js`, any others we add).
  - handles any errors that occur during query processing and communicates them back to the presentation layer.

### **4. Data Transformation (source/core)**

- **`data-transformation.js`** (if applicable):
  - if query involves data transformation (e.g., converting data between diff database schemas), this module takes care of applying schema mappings.
  - correctly transformed data then passed along w/ query to the corresponding adapter in the `transformation` layer.

### **5. Database Interaction (source/transformation)**

- **Adapter Modules (e.g., `sql-adapter.js`, `nosql-adapter.js`)**:
  - accurate adapter module receives execution plan and transformed data (if req'd) from the `query-processor.js`.
  - then executes query/operation on the specific type of database (e.g SQL, NoSQL, Graph).
  - retrieves results from the databse and passes them back up to the core logic layer.
  - handles db-specific errors and commuhicates them back to the `query-processor.js`.

### **6. Synchronization and Transactions (source/core)**

- **`synchronization-engine.js`** (if applicable):
  - if operation involves synchronizing data across multiple db's, this module manages the process of synchronizing it.
  - ensures consistency & resolves any conflicts that come up during synchronization
  - passes final synchronized data back to the `query-processor.js` (or directly to the presentation layer).

- **`transaction-manager.js`** (if applicable):
  - manages transactions across multiple databases in order to make usre the operations are all atomic.
  - if a transaction spans more than 1 query or databases, this module ensures that all operations are either fully completed or fully rolled back.
  - communicates status of the transaction (committed/rolled back) back to `query-processor.js`.

### **7. Returning Results to the User (source/presentation)**

- **`db-interface.js`**:
  - receives results or error messages from `query-processor.js`.
  - passes them back to the `cli-interface.js`.

- **`cli-interface.js`**:
  - displays final results.error messages to the user on command line.
  - user should be able to just input another command, repeating the process.

### **8. Cross-Cutting Concerns (source/cross-layer-services)**

- **`state-utils.js`**:
  - manages app state --active database connections and configurations.
  - enusere state changes are consistent and takes care of any state-related errors.

- **`logging.js`, `security.js`, `config-management.js`, `error-handling.js`**:
  - These modules handle logging, security, configuration management, and error handling across all layers.
  - They ensure that the application operates securely, reliably, and efficiently, regardless of the specific operations being performed.

### **Summary**
